# ⚠️ This version of CAutomator is DEPRECATED

You are looking at **CAutomator Legacy**, built on the Python engine. However, a new version built on the more reliable node.js engine exists, and has many of the features of Legacy, and has become the new main **CAutomator**. Please use http://github.com/hyperfresh/cautomator *in place of http://github.com/hyperfresh-cautomator-legacy* wherever possible.
